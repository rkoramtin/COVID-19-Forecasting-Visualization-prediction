# COVID-19-Forecasting-Visualization-prediction
Objective

This project aims to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic through a series of basic visualization techniques. It includes a comparative study of China, where the virus originated, against the rest of the world, as well as predictions and time-series forecasting to understand the potential spread and impact of the virus in the coming days.

Dataset Overview

The data, originally made available by Johns Hopkins University, is compiled into a time-series format detailing daily updates on the pandemic's progression since January 22, 2020. This dataset includes the cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across various global locations.
Column Description

The main file covid_19_data.csv includes the following columns:

    Sno - Serial number
    ObservationDate - Date of the observation in MM/DD/YYYY
    Province/State - Specific province or state of observation
    Country/Region - Country of observation
    Last Update - Time of the last update in UTC
    Confirmed - Cumulative number of confirmed cases up to the date
    Deaths - Cumulative number of deaths up to the date
    Recovered - Cumulative number of recoveries up to the date

Additional datasets for individual-level information and country-specific data are also mentioned, with respective sources for detailed study and analysis.

## Overview
